                        These terms and conditions (“User Terms“) apply to your visit to and your use of our website at www.Servy.co.za (the “Website“), the Service and the Application (as defined below), as well as to all information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or through the Website, the Service and the Application.
                       <br> PLEASE READ THESE USER TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING OUR APPLICATION AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE.
            </div>
					<div class="paraReg clrgreen pb32"> Servy<br>
                        Your contracting partner is Servy Limited. (“Servy”), a private limited liability company established in South Africa<br><br>
                        WHAT SERVICES DOES SERVY PROVIDE?<br>
                        Servy offers information and a means to obtain on-demand services offered by third party suppliers (the “Suppliers“), which may be requested through the use of an application supplied by Servy and downloaded and installed by you on your single mobile device (smart phone) (the “Application“). All services provided by servy to you by means of your use of the Application are hereafter referred to as the “Service“.<br><br>
                        HOW IS A CONTRACT CONCLUDED BETWEEN SERVY AND YOU?<br>
                        By using the Application or the Service, you enter into a contract with Servy (the “Contract“).<br> In order to be able to use the Application or Service, you first need to sign up with Servy. When signing up, you are obligated to provide Servy with your personal information, mobile telephone number and credit card data. Upon successful completion of your signing up with Servy, Servy will provide you with a personal account, accessible for you with a password of your choice.
                        You have to be 18 years of age or older to use the Service or Application. If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the Service or Application because of age, or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this one due to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not use the Service and the Application. You represent that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to enter into a binding contract, or that if you are registering on behalf of a legal entity, that you are authorized to enter into, and bind the entity to, these User Terms and register for the Service and the Application.<br><br>
                        HOW TO USE THE SERVICE AND THE APPLICATION<br>
                        The Application allows you to send a request for a service to a Supplier. The GPS receiver – which should be installed on the mobile device (smart phone) on which you have downloaded the Application – detects your location and sends your location information to the relevant Supplier. The Supplier has sole and complete discretion to accept or reject each request for Service. The Supplier also has sole and complete discretion over whether to use the Application to receive the leads generated through the Application. If the Supplier accepts a request, the Application notifies you and provides information regarding the Supplier – including its name, company name (where applicable), and customer service rating – and the ability to contact the Supplier by telephone. The Application also allows you to view the Supplier’s progress towards the pick-up point, in real time.
                        Servy shall procure reasonable efforts to bring you into contact with a Supplier in order to obtain services, subject to the availability of Suppliers in or around your location at the moment of your request for services.
                        For the avoidance of doubt: Servy itself does not provide services, and Servy is not a carrier. It is up to the Supplier to offer services, which may be requested through the use of the Application and/or the Service. Servy only acts as intermediary between you and the Supplier. The provision of the services by the Supplier to you is therefore subject to the agreement (to be) entered into between you and the Supplier. Servy shall never be a party to such agreement.<br><br>
                        YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION OR THE SERVICE<br>
                        You warrant that the information you provide to Servy is accurate and complete. Servy is entitled at all times to verify the information that you have provided and to refuse the Service or use of the Application without providing reasons.
                        You may only access the Service using authorised means. It is your responsibility to check to ensure you download the correct Application for your device. Servy is not liable if you do not have a compatible mobile device or if you download the wrong version of the Application for your mobile device. Servy reserves the right to terminate the Service and the use of the Application should you be using the Service or Application with an incompatible or unauthorized device.</div>
				
					<div class="headingr4 pb24 clrgreen">By using the Application or the Service, you further agree that:</div>
					<div class="paraSm clrgreen custom_left pb24">
						<ol class="custom_points">
							<li> You will only use the Service or download the Application for your sole, personal use and will not resell it to a third party;</li>
							<li>You will not authorise others to use your account;</li>
							<li>You will not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or legal entity;</li>
							<li>You will not use an account that is subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorisation;</li>
							<li>You will not use the Service or Application for unlawful purposes, including but not limited to sending or storing any unlawful material or for fraudulent purposes;</li>
              <li>You will not use the Service or Application to cause nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience;</li>
              <li>You will not impair the proper operation of the network;</li>
              <li>You will not try to harm the Service or Application in any way whatsoever;</li>
              <li>You will not copy, or distribute the Application or other Servy Content without written permission from Servy;</li>
              <li>You will keep secure and confidential your account password or any identification we provide you which allows access to the Service and the Application;</li>
              <li>You will provide us with whatever proof of identity we may reasonably request;</li>
              <li>You will only use an access point or 3G data account (AP) which you are authorized to use;</li>
              <li>You are aware that when requesting services by SMS (if available in your jurisdiction), standard messaging charges will apply;</li>
              <li>You will not use the Service or Application with an incompatible or unauthorised device;</li>
              <li>You will comply with all applicable law from your home nation, the country, state, province and/or city in which you are present while using the Application or Service.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="paraReg clrgreen mb32 bottom_border_pera">Servy reserves the right to immediately terminate the Service and the use of the Application should you not comply with any of the above rules.<br><br>
                    PAYMENT<br>
                    The use of the Application and the Service is free of charge. Servy reserves the right to introduce a fee for the use of the Application and/or the Service. If Servy decides to introduce such a fee, Servy shall inform you accordingly and allow you to either continue or terminate the Contract.
                    The rates that apply for the services by the Supplier can be found on the Website and through the Application. These may be modified or updated by Servy from time to time. It is your own responsibility to remain informed about the current rates for the services.<br>
                    Servy shall charge you for the services provided to you by the Supplier on behalf of the Supplier. You agree that you will pay for all services you purchase from the Supplier, and that Servy may charge your credit card account, or other payment account, as provided by you when registering for the Service for the services (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing Servy with a valid credit card account for payment of all fees at all times. Any payment made is non-refundable.<br>
                    Servy uses a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor“) to link your credit card account to the Application and Service. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Application and Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and your credit card issuer in addition to these User Terms. Servy is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor. In connection with your use of the Services, Servy will obtain certain transaction details, which Servy will use solely in accordance with its Privacy and Cookie Notice.<br><br>
                    INDEMNIFICATION<br>
                    By accepting these User Terms and using the Application or Service, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold Servy, its affiliates, its licensors, and each of their officers, directors, other users, employees, attorneys and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with:<br>
                    your violation or breach of any term of these User Terms or any applicable law or regulation, whether or not referenced herein;
your violation of any rights of any third party, including Suppliers arranged via the Application, or
your use or misuse of the Application or Service.<br><br>
LIABILITY<br>
The information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or through the Website, the Service and the Application is for general information purposes only and does not constitute advice. Servy will reasonably keep the Website and the Application and its contents correct and up to date but does not guarantee that (the contents of) the Website and/or Application are free of errors, defects, malware and viruses or that the Website and/or Application are correct, up to date and accurate.<br>
Servy shall not be liable for any damages resulting from the use of (or inability to use) the Website or Application (but to the exclusion of death or personal injury), including damages caused by malware, viruses or any incorrectness or incompleteness of the Information or the Website or Application, unless such damage is the result of any wilful misconduct or from gross negligence on the part of Servy.
Servy shall further not be liable for damages resulting from the use of (or the inability to use) electronic means of communication with the Website or the Application, including — but not limited to — damages resulting from failure or delay in delivery of electronic communications, interception or manipulation of electronic communications by third parties or by computer programs used for electronic communications and transmission of viruses.<br>
Without prejudice to the foregoing, and insofar as allowed under mandatory applicable law, Servy aggregate liability shall in no event exceed an amount of £500 or, where applicable, the equivalent of that amount in the currency used by you for the payment of the services to the Supplier.<br>
The quality of the services requested through the use of the Application or the Service is entirely the responsibility of the Supplier who ultimately provides such services to you. Servy under no circumstance accepts liability in connection with and/or arising from the services provided by the Supplier or any acts, actions, behaviour, conduct, and/or negligence on the part of the Supplier. Any complaints about the services provided by the Supplier should therefore be submitted to Servy and the Supplier but will be the responsibility of the Supplier to remedy.<br><br>
